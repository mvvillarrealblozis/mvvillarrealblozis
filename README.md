# Hey, I'm Maximiliano Villarreal-Blozis

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of San Francisco (Cum Laude, B.S. in CS with a Business Analytics minor).  
I’m passionate about **embedded systems, automation, and hardware-software integration**, and I’m currently preparing for graduate study in **Electrical and Computer Engineering**, with an emphasis on embedded design, FPGA development, and digital systems.

### What I’ve Built

**RISC-V Processors**  
Designed both single-cycle and pipelined RISC-V CPUs, including a hazard-unit implementation for branch and data dependency handling.

**Operating Systems Work (xv6)**  
Implemented multiple shell utilities and system calls (e.g., `kill`, `df`, `trace`) to understand process management, I/O, and scheduling.

**Data Logger System (Jacobi Motors LLC)**  
Developed a multi-process telemetry logger on Raspberry Pi 4 using Python, PyDrive, and 4G HAT modules.  
Included file compression, error handling, and automated Google Drive uploads for remote data collection.

**PyQt5 GUI & Dockerized Tools**  
Built a cross-platform desktop interface for the company’s dyno automation toolchain, containerized with Docker + WSL for Windows deployment.

**Robotics & Computer Vision**  
Led a 7-member team developing a Raspberry Pi based robotic arm with OpenCV object tracking and an IoT plant-watering system.
